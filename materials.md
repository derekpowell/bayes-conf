The scientific consensus on climate change is overwhelmingly clear: Nearly all scientists believe that the earth is warming and that human CO2 emissions from the burning of fossil fuels are a major cause of that change. A 2009 survey of 3,146 earth scientists found that among those active in their fields about 89% agreed that human activity was a significant contributing factor in climate change. These respondents were scientists working in a variety of fields, including geology, geochemistry, geophysics, oceanography, and others. The consensus among scientists specializing in climate research is even stronger: A 2013 study found that 97% of climate scientists agree that human activity is driving global warming. And more recent surveys have found that number has now increased to over 99%. The American Association for the Advancement of Science explains that the consensus around the link between human CO2 emissions and global temperature change is as strong as the consensus around the link between smoking and lung cancer.

### Question:

Scientists have been measuring temperatures all over the globe for many years. Since 1880, average temperatures have risen by about 1.9 degrees F (1.1 degrees C). This is typically referred to as “global warming” or “climate change”.

What is the probability that human CO2 emissions are the primary cause of rising global temperatures?

## Fentanyl

### Evidence:

Medical experts have roundly rejected concerns about fentanyl overdose from skin contact or inhalation as entirely unfounded. "It is very clear that you cannot overdose by touching fentanyl," said Dr. Leo Beletsky. “it is not biologically possible” to experience overdose symptoms, or to die, from touching or being exposed to the drug he explained. To illustrate further, he points to the special biomedical designs needed to develop Fentanyl patches that support pain management by allowing Fentanyl to be absorbed through skin. The patches require special gels, and take hours to deliver Fentanyl to the patient. Dr. Andrew Stolbach, an emergency physician and medical toxicologist at Johns Hopkins Hospital concurs: “It's not possible to overdose on fentanyl by touching it. If it was absorbed well through the skin, people wouldn’t inject it and snort it in order to get high.” Efforts are underway to better educate police departments and correct myths about Fentanyl. Experts say this is important both to support police and emergency medical responders to more quickly intervene to prevent overdose deaths and to relieve undue stress on officers who come into contact with the drug.

### Question:

Fentanyl is a powerful synthetic opioid that has lead to a sharp increase in overdose deaths among opioid users over the last few years.

What is the probability that skin contact with Fentanyl could cause an overdose?

## Learning styles

### Evidence:

**The following information is based on academic research and news articles. Please read this information carefully.**

Scientists do agree that it is clear that people have preferences about their learning: different students often like or enjoy different kinds of lessons. However, there is simply no good evidence that catering to those preferences improves learning outcomes. This was the conclusion that was reached by a team of eminent learning psychologists and neuroscientists who reviewed the existing literature on learning styles. If there is truth to the idea that learning styles and teaching styles should mesh, then learners with a given style, say visual-spatial, should learn better with instruction that meshes with that style. Furthermore, randomized controlled trials would be necessary to test this hypothesis. These researchers found that nearly all of the studies claiming to show evidence that tailoring teaching to learning styles improved learning failed to satisfy these key criteria for scientific validity. A more recent systematic review found that of 1400 articles claiming to show evidence for learning styles, only 31 used appropriate research designs. And of those 31, only two found any evidence supporting the existence of learning styles.


### Question:

Some people think that that people have different “learning styles.” For instance, some people think that certain people learn better from visual instruction, others from verbal instruction, and still others from active participation.

What is the probability that school curriculums designed to tailor to individual students’ learning styles improve students’ learning?

## Stadium

### Evidence:

**The following information is based on academic research and news articles. Please read this information carefully.**

Economists generally oppose subsidizing professional sports stadiums. When surveyed in a 2017 poll, 83 percent of the economists surveyed agreed that "Providing state and local subsidies to build stadiums for professional sports teams is likely to cost the relevant taxpayers more than any local economic benefits that are generated.” In their book, Sports, Jobs, and Taxes, Roger Noll and Andrew Zimbalist present a comprehensive review of stadium investments. In all cases, they find a new sports facility to have extremely small (or negative) effects on overall economic activity and employment. Furthermore, they were unable to find any facilities that had a reasonable return on investment. Sports economist Michael Leeds suggests that professional sports have very little economic impact, noting that a baseball team (with 81 regular-season home games per year) "has about the same impact on a community as a midsize department store".


### Question:

The state of New York and Erie County are together planning to earmark $850 million to support construction of a new stadium for the NFL team the Buffalo Bills. The total budget is projected at $1.4 billion, bringing the public contribution to 61% of the total cost.

What is the probability that the new stadium will have a positive economic impact that will pay taxpayers back for their investment?
